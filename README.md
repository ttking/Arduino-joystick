This is my arduino to unity assignment where we connected a joystick to unity so we could make a cube rotate.

##*Route to the code*

1. Assets
2. Scripts
3. SerialRotation.cs

To get the code working correctly you need to follow the following steps.

1. Go to edit
2. Project settings
3. Optimisation api compatibility change to .Net 2.0
4. Change "Com" in the code to the one that is being used for you.
